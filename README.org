- build a time counter?
- one can control how fast it flush?

Five months in, zero progress in physical assemble. Gradually picking
up the peace. Slowly but surely.

First thing I know is that we have a frequency producer from
electricity. How can I transfer it to a controllable sparking stars?

Nature is continues, human make white and black.

I think it is the tweak between point 6 and 2 makes the capacity
charges and discharges back and forth. And during this change, voltage
has a periodic feature between points (two of 7,6,2). And the rules
say that if the detected voltage is higher, then the output is 1;
otherwise 0.

Today, I start to build the real thing. I took the wire from a old
mouse, connecting it with the 5 DC voltage convert in such a way that
I don't feel very comfortable.

Follow Ben's watch was easy. I do have issue to understand how the
breadboard's connection at first. I miss understand the wires
parallel connected to the 1k resistor and capacitor short the circuit.
It did not.

After Ben's connection, I made my own version.
*** <2020-05-30 Sat> read internal diagram of IC555
*** <2020-06-03 Wed> improve the voltage source connector and reading some about circuit
- start to learn common emitter (CE), common collector (CC), and
  common base (CB)
- start to read RS FF within transistor
** question
*** DONE Can we use AC to make the square output?
It's okay, but the problem is that we need to build a "black box" that
is able to change it's frequency, i.e., how fast the stars blinking.

The beauty of using IC555 is that one can change resistance of
resistor to change the blinking frequency.
*** TODO Explain the role of bipolar junction transistor's role in IC555.
