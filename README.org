Five months in, zero progress in physical assemble. Gradually picking
up the peace. Slowly but surely.

First thing I know is that we have a frequency producer from
electricity. How can I transfer it to a controllable sparking stars?

Nature is continues, human make white and black.

I think it is the tweak between point 6 and 2 makes the capacity
charges and discharges back and forth. And during this change, voltage
has a periodic feature between points (two of 7,6,2). And the rules
say that if the detected voltage is higher, then the output is 1;
otherwise 0.
*** <2020-05-26 Tue>
Today, I start to build the real thing. I took the wire from a old
mouse, connecting it with the 5 DC voltage convert in such a way that
I don't feel very comfortable.

Follow Ben's watch was easy. I do have issue to understand how the
breadboard's connection at first. I miss understand the wires
parallel connected to the 1k resistor and capacitor short the circuit.
It did not.

After Ben's connection, I made my own version.
*** <2020-05-30 Sat> read internal diagram of IC555
*** <2020-06-03 Wed> improve the voltage source connector and reading some about circuit
- start to learn common emitter (CE), common collector (CC), and
  common base (CB)
- start to read RS FF within transistor
*** <2020-06-05 Fri> understand the role of NPN in IC555
*** <2020-06-06 Sat> install adjustable blinking frequency controller
I had an issue for choosing the right resistor between 555's pin-7 and
pin-6. Previous to this point, I installed an 1 M Ohm and I found a
equal blinking frequency. However, the teacher has a 100k Ohm
resistor, which I do not have.

I did a test using a 220 Ohm resistor and I found the LED stayed on
but not blinking. Then I check the document and found the relation
between t1 and t2. It can have a relation as t1/t2= 1 + R_A + R_B.
This indicates that if R_B is much greater than R_A, then the gap
between LED on and off should equal. This was what happen when I
installed a 1 M Ohm resistor in between 555' pin-6 and pin-7.
*** <2020-06-07 Sun> build monostable clock
The monostable clock means that you push the button, the LED flushes;
released closed. It took me a while to find the bad connection in
momentary pushbutton.

As I march on the third clock, I did not make it successfully. The
slide switch is different from the teacher's circuit. I need to
further study how to tweak SR latch to make this final clock.
*** <2020-06-08 Mon> debug monostable clock
I checked the circuit many times yesterday and today, and I could not
make the monostable clock flushing. I even test the slide switch to
make sure the relation between three pins. I also replaced the IC555
with flushing clock module, and still don't know why the LED stayed
died.

Amazing things happen, during switching these LEDs to make sure they
are still functioning. One time, when I install the LED, the LED start
to live and stay that state! I suddenly realize that LED is short for
Light-Emitting diodes. It's a diode. It must be installed in the
correct direction. Then, I reverse all other LEDs to test it. It is
true. How lucky I was, when do know this feature of LED.
*** <2020-06-09 Tue> finish time module
- Auto mode: https://youtu.be/XRqyO3dbzqk
- Manual control mode: https://youtu.be/s8hCcCtMwFw

Made the time module as a whole package. From a function
point of view, the inputs are:

- slide switch: control which mode the user wants
- a button: if the user wants manual control, it is another input that
  the user gives to the function

Out put is the blue LEDs. To more precise, how LED flushes.
*** <2020-06-10 Wed> review a bit of memory and register
- a bit of memory

  One bit of memory is built by four NAND gates, these four gates
  create a function that has two inputs and one output.

  Suppose one time period, one can turn on and off the set wire of this
  function. During this time period, one can connect another function to
  this function. After this time period, the output of this function
  is alway set the state that is the same as another function.

  That's how four NAND gates remember things.

- register

  It's a combination of Byte and an Enabler.

** question
*** DONE Can we use AC to make the square output?
It's okay, but the problem is that we need to build a "black box" that
is able to change it's frequency, i.e., how fast the stars blinking.

The beauty of using IC555 is that one can change resistance of
resistor to change the blinking frequency.
*** DONE When 555 working, what is the role of npn transistor that is connected to Q?

    (or Explain the role of bipolar junction transistor's role in IC555.)

    If there is zero voltage between Base and Emitter, no matter how
    high (smaller than breakdown voltage) the voltage between the
    Collector and Emitter, there is almost zero current in collector.

    If the Q is on, the NPN transistor is in active region. The
    current between the Collector and Emitter exist.
