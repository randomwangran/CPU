Five months in, zero progress in physical assemble. Gradually picking
up the peace. Slowly but surely.

First thing I know is that we have a frequency producer from
electricity. How can I transfer it to a controllable sparking stars?

Nature is continues, human make white and black.

I think it is the tweak between point 6 and 2 makes the capacity
charges and discharges back and forth. And during this change, voltage
has a periodic feature between points (two of 7,6,2). And the rules
say that if the detected voltage is higher, then the output is 1;
otherwise 0.

The next question is why not just use AC?
